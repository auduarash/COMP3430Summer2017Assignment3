# The program works as follows

## To compile, run the command
`make`  

or 

` make fat32 `

## Then run using
` ./fat32 <diskimagelocation> `

## All commands are whitespace safe, you can have any amount of whitespaces before and after each command and between arguments.

## The bonus question (2) for the sequential cluster reads during file downloads has been implemented. The area of the code that handles that has a comment which reads
```//THIS PART HANDLES READING IN OF SEQUENTIAL CLUSTERS```

## Thank you.
